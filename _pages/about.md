Hi everyone, I'm Hongcan Guo, a Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence LOVERÔºÅ This is my home, and I'll be sharing some updates about my research life here. Welcome to visit!
I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of AI](https://ai.bupt.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). My research interest includes pattern recognition, machine learning, natural language processing and mathematics.


RECENT NEWS
======
+ Contributed a JSAC paper, completed the algorithm design, framework design and LLM-related experimental parts of it, and had a great time!
+ Finished a small little app for generating videos from images and text-InspiroV, which has been open-sourced to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HongcanGuo/InspiroV), feel free to use it!

Latest Research Directions
======
1. Lightweighting and distributed deployment of Large Language Models.
1. Optimizing LoRa algorithm through dynamic algorithm and matrix calculation.
1. Construct a new interpretable neural network construction.

**Lightweighting and distributed deployment of Large Language Models**
Physical deployment using methods related to model compression is under preparation and is expected to be submitted to Mobicom at the end of August.

**Optimizing LoRa algorithm**
I'm trying a simple experiment, the idea is not yet mature, and I mainly want to start with dynamic optimization of algorithms.

**New interpretable neural network**
Combining algebra method, I want to construct an interpretable neural network which is more consistent with bionics and human thinking mode.

STATUS
======
Final exam week, exhausted! QAQ
