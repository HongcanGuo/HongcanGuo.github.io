Hello everyone, I'm Hongcan Guo, a mathematics and artificial intelligence enthusiast! This is my homepage, where I will share some of the latest updates about my research life. Welcome!

I am an undergraduate student from the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.bupt.edu.cn/) at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). Currently, I am a research intern at [ByteDance Seed Vision](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/direction/vision). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models, Unsupervised Learning, and Mathematics.

I am currently applying for PhD programs for Fall 2026. If you are a professor interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me at [Email](ai.guohc@bupt.edu.cn).
